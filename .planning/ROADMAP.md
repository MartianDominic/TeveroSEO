# Roadmap: TeveroSEO Unified Platform

## Milestones

- ✅ **v1.0 Platform Unification** — Phases 1–7 (complete)
- 🚧 **v2.0 Unified Product** — Phases 8–12 (scoped 2026-04-17)

## Phases

### Phase 1: AI-Writer Backend Cleanup
**Goal**: All legacy non-agency service directories removed from AI-Writer backend with no broken imports or test failures.
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: CLEAN-01, CLEAN-02, CLEAN-03, CLEAN-04, CLEAN-05, CLEAN-06, CLEAN-07
**Working directory**: `AI-Writer/`
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `grep -r "blog_writer\|podcast\|youtube\|story_writer\|linkedin" AI-Writer/backend/api/` returns zero matches
  2. `ls AI-Writer/backend/services/` shows no legacy directories (blog_writer, podcast, youtube, story_writer, linkedin)
  3. Backend starts without import errors: `docker compose run --rm ai-writer-backend python -c "from main import app"` succeeds
**Plans**: 5 plans
  - [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Strip legacy routers and podcast-only demo mode from entry points, registries, logging, and startup scripts (Wave 1)
  - [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Delete wrapper services/routers that bridge to legacy modules; inline exception/retry utilities; neutralize research_engine providers (Wave 1)
  - [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Delete legacy scripts and model files; update services/database.py and test fixtures (Wave 1)
  - [x] 01-04-PLAN.md — Delete legacy service directories, API directories, and linkedin_image_generation.py (Wave 2)
  - [x] 01-05-PLAN.md — Verification: grep/ls checks, backend import smoke test, pytest run, produce VERIFICATION.md (Wave 3)

---

### Phase 2: CF Bindings Removal + Schema Migration
**Goal**: open-seo-main compiles and runs as a Node.js server with no Cloudflare runtime dependencies and a PostgreSQL-dialect Drizzle schema.
**Depends on**: Nothing (can run parallel with Phase 1)
**Requirements**: CF-01, CF-02, CF-03, CF-04, CF-05, CF-06, DB-01, DB-02, DB-03, DB-04, DB-05, DB-06, DB-07, DB-08, BUILD-01, BUILD-02, BUILD-03
**Working directory**: `open-seo-main/`
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `grep -r "cloudflare:workers" open-seo-main/src/` returns zero matches
  2. `pnpm run build` completes with no TypeScript or Rollup errors and produces `.output/server/index.mjs`
  3. `node .output/server/index.mjs` starts an HTTP server and all routes return correct responses
  4. `drizzle-kit migrate` applies all PG-dialect migrations to a fresh PostgreSQL instance without errors
**Plans**: 6 plans
  - [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Package + vite + drizzle + tsconfig + env.d.ts + wrangler removal (Wave 1, foundation)
  - [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Migrate Drizzle schema from sqlite-core to pg-core, 14 tables, jsonb + boolean + timestamp tz (Wave 2)
  - [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Rewrite src/db/index.ts for node-postgres pool; rewrite runtime-env.ts for process.env + validateEnv (Wave 2)
  - [x] 02-04-PLAN.md — Remove cloudflare:workers from auth, email, posthog, dataforseo, routes, middleware; swap better-auth to provider pg (Wave 3)
  - [x] 02-05-PLAN.md — Stub SiteAuditWorkflow + progress-kv (in-memory) + R2 (filesystem); rewrite src/server.ts as Node entry; stub AuditService (Wave 3)
  - [x] 02-06-PLAN.md — [BLOCKING] Regenerate PG migrations; drizzle-kit migrate against local PG; verify pnpm build + Node runtime (Wave 4, checkpoint)

---

### Phase 3: BullMQ + Redis KV Replacement
**Goal**: Site audit jobs run reliably via BullMQ on Redis; no Cloudflare runtime references remain in the audit path.
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: KV-01, KV-02, KV-03, BQ-01, BQ-02, BQ-03, BQ-04, BQ-05, BQ-06, BQ-07
**Working directory**: `open-seo-main/`
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Triggering a site audit enqueues a BullMQ job and the worker executes all steps to completion
  2. Audit crawl progress reads/writes via ioredis with correct TTL semantics (`audit-progress:` prefix, 30-min expiry)
  3. Failed jobs after max retries appear in `failed-audits` dead-letter queue
**Plans**: 4 plans
  - [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Foundation: ioredis singleton + BullMQ Queue/DLQ definitions + REDIS_URL added to REQUIRED_ENV_CORE (Wave 1)
  - [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Rewrite progress-kv.ts against ioredis singleton with audit-progress: prefix and 30-min TTL (Wave 2)
  - [x] 03-03-PLAN.md — BullMQ Worker + sandboxed processor (120s lock, maxStalledCount 2, DLQ on exhausted retries, 25s graceful shutdown) (Wave 2)
  - [x] 03-04-PLAN.md — Wire AuditService.startAudit/remove to auditQueue; start Worker + SIGTERM/SIGINT shutdown in src/server.ts (Wave 3)

---

### Phase 4: Unified Docker Infrastructure
**Goal**: Both platforms run on a single VPS behind one nginx, sharing PostgreSQL and Redis, with a single `docker compose up` command.
**Depends on**: Phase 2, Phase 3 (open-seo Node.js stable), Phase 1 (AI-Writer cleaned)
**Requirements**: DOCKER-01, DOCKER-02, DOCKER-03, DOCKER-04, DOCKER-05, DOCKER-06, DOCKER-07
**Working directory**: `/` (TeveroSEO root — new unified docker-compose.vps.yml)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `docker compose -f docker-compose.vps.yml up -d` at TeveroSEO root brings all 7 services up healthy
  2. `curl https://app.openseo.so/healthz` returns `{ status: "ok" }`
  3. `curl https://<ai-writer-domain>/api/health` returns 200
  4. `docker compose -f docker-compose.vps.yml ps` shows all services as healthy
**Plans**: 4 plans
  - [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Add /healthz route to open-seo-main for container healthcheck (Wave 1)
  - [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Multi-stage Dockerfile.vps for open-seo with worker variant support (Wave 1)
  - [x] 04-03-PLAN.md — Supporting infra config files: postgres init SQL, nginx reverse proxy, redis config (Wave 1)
  - [x] 04-04-PLAN.md — Unified docker-compose.vps.yml wiring all 7 services with healthchecks + end-to-end smoke verification (Wave 2, checkpoint)

---

### Phase 5: CI/CD Pipeline
**Goal**: Both platforms auto-deploy to VPS on push to main with zero manual intervention; migrations run before new containers go live.
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: CI-01, CI-02, CI-03, CI-04, CI-05, CI-06
**Working directory**: TeveroSEO root (shared `.github/workflows/`)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Pushing to `main` triggers deploy workflow; VPS shows new container within 5 minutes
  2. GitHub Actions workflow completes green with migration step before container swap
  3. `KNOWN_HOSTS` used; no `StrictHostKeyChecking=no`
  4. AI-Writer auto-deploys via separate parallel workflow
**Plans**: 3 plans
  - [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — Add `open-seo-migrate` one-shot service (migrate-entry.ts + Dockerfile.vps esbuild bundle + compose profile) (Wave 1)
  - [x] 05-02-PLAN.md — `.github/workflows/deploy-vps.yml` — SSH with KNOWN_HOSTS, migrate before container swap, rebuild open-seo + open-seo-worker (Wave 2)
  - [x] 05-03-PLAN.md — `.github/workflows/deploy-ai-writer.yml` — parallel SSH deploy for ai-writer-backend + ai-writer-frontend, no migration step (Wave 2)

---

### Phase 6: Clerk + Per-Client Workspace Integration
**Goal**: open-seo-main authenticates via Clerk and scopes all audit/keyword data by `client_id` from AI-Writer's client registry.
**Depends on**: Phase 4 (unified infra running)
**Requirements**: AUTH-01, AUTH-02, AUTH-03, AUTH-04
**Working directory**: `open-seo-main/`
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Unauthenticated requests to open-seo API return 401; authenticated requests with valid Clerk session succeed
  2. `GET /api/audits?client_id=X` returns only audits for client X
  3. Passing an invalid `client_id` returns 403
**Plans**: 3 plans
  - [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — client-context lib + ALWRITY_DATABASE_URL env wiring (Wave 1, AUTH-03 foundation)
  - [x] 06-02-PLAN.md — [BLOCKING] Add client_id column + index to audits table via Drizzle migration (Wave 1, AUTH-04 foundation)
  - [x] 06-03-PLAN.md — Wire clientId through middleware + AuditService + serverFunctions + docs AUTH-01/02 (Wave 2, checkpoint)

---

### Phase 7: AppShell SEO Integration
**Goal**: SEO audit and keyword tools appear as a nav section in the AI-Writer AppShell; active client context passes automatically to open-seo pages.
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Requirements**: SHELL-01, SHELL-02, SHELL-03, SHELL-04, SHELL-05
**Working directory**: `AI-Writer/`
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. "SEO Audit" nav item visible in AI-Writer sidebar; clicking it loads open-seo pages without a page reload
  2. Switching client in the switcher updates the `client_id` passed to open-seo pages
  3. open-seo pages use the same StatusChip, PageHeader, and CSS tokens as the rest of the shell
**Plans**: TBD (planning in progress)

---

## v2.0 Unified Product

> **Milestone goal**: One Next.js 15 app at `app.tevero.lt`. Single login via Clerk. All AI-Writer and SEO features as first-class routes. Per-client credentials (GSC, GA4, Bing) stored in PostgreSQL, collected via branded invite links. Nightly analytics sync across 100 clients with anomaly surfacing. Two backends (FastAPI + Node.js) unchanged — only the frontend shell is new.

---

### Phase 8: Next.js Unified Shell
**Goal**: A new Next.js 15 App Router app (`apps/web`) replaces both CRA frontends. All existing AI-Writer routes work. Clerk auth via `@clerk/nextjs` middleware. Both backends called server-side — zero cross-origin requests from the browser. Old CRA frontend retired.
**Depends on**: Phase 7 complete
**Requirements**: NEXT-01 through NEXT-10
**Working directory**: `apps/web/` (new), `docker/`, root
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `apps/web` builds with `next build` — zero TypeScript errors
  2. All 10 AI-Writer pages accessible at equivalent routes under `/clients/[id]/*` with Clerk protection
  3. `curl https://app.tevero.lt/api/health` proxied through Next.js server action returns 200
  4. `docker compose -f docker-compose.vps.yml up` replaces `ai-writer-frontend` container with `web` container; nginx updated
  5. Signing in with Clerk grants access; unauthenticated visits redirect to `/sign-in`
**Estimated effort**: 3 weeks
**Plans**: 6 plans
  - [x] 08-01-PLAN.md — pnpm workspace scaffold + Next.js 15 App Router + Tailwind v4 + standalone output (Wave 1)
  - [x] 08-02-PLAN.md — @clerk/nextjs v6 middleware + ClerkProvider + sign-in/sign-up pages + /api/health (Wave 2)
  - [x] 08-03-PLAN.md — clientStore + server-fetch + 22 shadcn/ui components (Wave 2)
  - [x] 08-04-PLAN.md — AppShell + ClientSwitcher + ThemeContext ported; (shell) route group layout; /api/clients, /api/clients/[id], /api/platform-secrets/status proxy routes (Wave 3)
  - [x] 08-05-PLAN.md — (Wave 3)
  - [x] 08-06-PLAN.md — (Wave 3)

---

### Phase 9: Shared UI Package + Design System
**Goal**: All ~50 duplicate shadcn/ui components extracted into `packages/ui`. Single Tailwind config. Both backends' frontends (open-seo routes ported in Phase 10) import from `packages/ui`. Design tokens consistent across entire product.
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Requirements**: UI-01 through UI-08
**Working directory**: `packages/ui/` (new), `apps/web/`
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `packages/ui` exports all shared components — `grep -r "from.*components/ui"` in `apps/web/` returns zero matches (all imports from `@tevero/ui`)
  2. Single `tailwind.config.ts` in `packages/ui` extended by `apps/web`
  3. Storybook (or equivalent) renders all components in isolation
  4. `pnpm build` at monorepo root succeeds with no type errors
**Estimated effort**: 1 week
**Plans**: 3 plans
  - [x] 09-01-PLAN.md — Bootstrap packages/ui and packages/types as workspace packages (Wave 1)
  - [x] 09-02-PLAN.md — Copy 22 components into packages/ui/src/components/ with barrel export (Wave 2)
  - [x] 09-03-PLAN.md — Rewire apps/web imports to @tevero/ui; delete local components/ui/ copies (Wave 3)

---

### Phase 10: open-seo Frontend Absorption
**Goal**: All open-seo UI routes ported into `apps/web` as Next.js App Router pages under `/clients/[id]/seo/*`. open-seo Node.js backend called via server actions — no iframe, no second domain. `seo.tevero.lt` DNS record retired. better-auth sign-in/sign-up routes deleted. open-seo Node.js process kept as pure API backend.
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Requirements**: ABSORB-01 through ABSORB-12
**Working directory**: `apps/web/`, `open-seo-main/`
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `/clients/[id]/seo/audit`, `/clients/[id]/seo/keywords`, `/clients/[id]/seo/backlinks`, `/clients/[id]/seo/domain`, `/clients/[id]/seo/saved`, `/clients/[id]/seo/ai` all render correctly
  2. `grep -r "iframe" apps/web/src/` returns zero matches
  3. `seo.tevero.lt` nginx block removed; only `app.tevero.lt` remains
  4. open-seo sign-in/sign-up routes (`_auth.sign-in.tsx`, `_auth.sign-up.tsx`) deleted from `open-seo-main/src/routes/`
  5. All open-seo API calls go through Next.js server actions; no cross-origin requests
**Estimated effort**: 2–3 weeks
**Plans**: 4 plans
  - [ ] 14-01-PLAN.md — TypeScript types + FastAPI dashboard endpoint + Dashboard nav item (Wave 1)
  - [ ] 14-02-PLAN.md — Dashboard page with StatusBadge, DashboardTable, needs attention section (Wave 2)
  - [ ] 14-03-PLAN.md — Chart components: GSCChart, GA4Chart, QueriesTable, DateRangeSelector, StatCard (Wave 2)
  - [ ] 14-04-PLAN.md — Per-client analytics page with server action and human verification (Wave 3, checkpoint)

---

### Phase 11: Clerk Auth Unified — open-seo Backend
**Goal**: open-seo Node.js backend accepts Clerk JWTs. better-auth removed entirely. User logs in once via Clerk; all open-seo API calls authenticated with the same token. `session`, `account`, `verification` tables dropped. `clerk_user_id` column added to open-seo `user` table.
**Depends on**: Phase 10 (open-seo frontend absorbed; sign-in routes gone)
**Requirements**: UNAUTH-01 through UNAUTH-08
**Working directory**: `open-seo-main/`
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `curl https://app.tevero.lt/seo-api/healthz` with valid Clerk JWT in `Authorization: Bearer` returns 200; without token returns 401
  2. `grep -r "better-auth\|betterAuth" open-seo-main/src/` returns zero matches
  3. Drizzle migration drops `session`, `account`, `verification` tables; adds `clerk_user_id` to `user`
  4. `pnpm --filter open-seo-main tsc --noEmit` passes
  5. Existing audit + keyword data intact after migration (no data loss)
**Estimated effort**: 1–2 weeks
**Plans**: 4 plans
  - [x] 11-01-PLAN.md — Add Clerk JWT verification library (jose) (Wave 1)
  - [x] 11-02-PLAN.md — Drizzle migration: clerk_user_id column, drop session/account/verification tables (Wave 1)
  - [x] 11-03-PLAN.md — Rewrite auth middleware to use Clerk JWT (Wave 2)
  - [x] 11-04-PLAN.md — Remove better-auth package and all references (Wave 3)

---

### Phase 12: Per-Client Credentials System
**Goal**: Agency staff connect client Google (GSC + GA4 + GBP), Bing, and other OAuth providers per client — not per user. Credentials stored encrypted in PostgreSQL against `client_id`. Magic-link invite page (`/connect/[token]`) lets clients self-authorize without an account. Connection status visible at `/clients/[id]/connections`.
**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Requirements**: CREDS-01 through CREDS-14
**Working directory**: `apps/web/`, `AI-Writer/backend/`
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `client_oauth_tokens` and `client_connect_invites` tables created via Alembic migration
  2. `GET /clients/[id]/connections` shows connection status for Google, Bing, WordPress, Shopify, Wix
  3. Generating an invite link and visiting `/connect/[token]` completes Google OAuth and stores token against `client_id` (not user)
  4. Expired/invalid invite tokens return a clear error page — not a 500
  5. Existing per-user GSC/Bing credentials in SQLite migrated to per-client PostgreSQL
  6. `grep -r "gsc_credentials\|bing_oauth_tokens" AI-Writer/backend/services/` — old SQLite-backed credential tables replaced
**Estimated effort**: 3 weeks
**Plans**: 4 plans
  - [x] 12-01-PLAN.md — Alembic migration + ORM models for client_oauth_tokens, client_oauth_properties, client_connect_invites (Wave 1)
  - [x] 12-02-PLAN.md — ClientOAuthService + API router: invite generation, OAuth flow, callback handling (Wave 2)
  - [x] 12-03-PLAN.md — Next.js /connect/[token] magic link page + /clients/[id]/connections UI (Wave 3, checkpoint)
  - [x] 12-04-PLAN.md — Migration script: per-user SQLite credentials to per-client PostgreSQL (Wave 4, checkpoint)

---

### Phase 13: Analytics Data Layer
**Goal**: Nightly BullMQ workers sync GSC and GA4 data for every connected client into `gsc_snapshots` and `ga4_snapshots` tables. 90-day historical backfill on first connect. Token refresh handled automatically; failed refreshes flagged per client. Data available for all dashboard queries within 2h of connection.
**Depends on**: Phase 12
**Requirements**: ANALYTICS-01 through ANALYTICS-10
**Working directory**: `AI-Writer/backend/`, `open-seo-main/` (BullMQ workers)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `gsc_snapshots` and `ga4_snapshots` tables created and populated for all clients with active Google tokens
  2. BullMQ job `sync-client-analytics` runs nightly at 02:00 UTC; `docker compose logs open-seo-worker` shows successful sync entries
  3. Token expiry within 24h triggers automatic refresh; failure sets `is_active=false` and surfaces in connection status UI
  4. 90-day backfill completes for a new connection within 10 minutes
  5. `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM gsc_snapshots WHERE client_id = $1` returns >= 30 rows after backfill
**Estimated effort**: 2 weeks
**Plans**: 5 plans
  - [x] 13-01-PLAN.md — Alembic migration 0013 + ORM models + internal API endpoint for token access (Wave 1)
  - [x] 13-02-PLAN.md — BullMQ analytics queue + worker infrastructure + aiwriter-api client (Wave 2)
  - [x] 13-03-PLAN.md — GSC/GA4 sync processor + google-auth token refresh + internal API token update endpoints (Wave 3)
  - [x] 13-04-PLAN.md — Drizzle schema + backfill trigger on OAuth callback (Wave 3)
  - [x] 13-05-PLAN.md — Server integration + docker-compose env vars + verification checkpoint (Wave 4)

---

### Phase 14: Analytics UX — Agency Dashboard + Per-Client Views
**Goal**: `/dashboard` shows all clients' organic traffic health at a glance with anomaly flags. `/clients/[id]/analytics` shows GSC + GA4 side by side with 30/90-day trend charts and top queries. Clients with no connection show inline "Send invite" CTA. Traffic drops >20% WoW auto-flagged at top of dashboard.
**Depends on**: Phase 13
**Requirements**: UX-01 through UX-12
**Working directory**: `apps/web/`
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `/dashboard` loads in < 1s (server-rendered, data from PostgreSQL snapshots — no live API calls)
  2. A client with a GSC token shows clicks, impressions, CTR, avg position for last 30 days
  3. A client with clicks down >20% WoW appears in a "Needs attention" section at dashboard top
  4. A client with no Google connection shows "Connect Google" / "Send invite link" CTA inline
  5. `/clients/[id]/analytics` renders GSC line chart + GA4 summary + top 10 queries table
  6. Recharts used for all charts; no additional charting library added
**Estimated effort**: 2 weeks
**Plans**: 4 plans (2 complete)
  - [x] 14-01-PLAN.md — TypeScript types + FastAPI dashboard endpoint + Dashboard nav item (Wave 1)
  - [x] 14-02-PLAN.md — Dashboard page with StatusBadge, DashboardTable, needs attention section (Wave 2)
  - [ ] 14-03-PLAN.md — Chart components: GSCChart, GA4Chart, QueriesTable, DateRangeSelector, StatCard (Wave 2)
  - [ ] 14-04-PLAN.md — Per-client analytics page with server action and human verification (Wave 3, checkpoint)
