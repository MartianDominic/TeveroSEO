# Roadmap: TeveroSEO Unified Platform

## Milestones

- 🚧 **v1.0 Platform Unification** — Phases 1–7 (in progress)

## Phases

### Phase 1: AI-Writer Backend Cleanup
**Goal**: All legacy non-agency service directories removed from AI-Writer backend with no broken imports or test failures.
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: CLEAN-01, CLEAN-02, CLEAN-03, CLEAN-04, CLEAN-05, CLEAN-06, CLEAN-07
**Working directory**: `AI-Writer/`
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `grep -r "blog_writer\|podcast\|youtube\|story_writer\|linkedin" AI-Writer/backend/api/` returns zero matches
  2. `ls AI-Writer/backend/services/` shows no legacy directories (blog_writer, podcast, youtube, story_writer, linkedin)
  3. Backend starts without import errors: `docker compose run --rm ai-writer-backend python -c "from main import app"` succeeds
**Plans**: 5 plans
  - [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Strip legacy routers and podcast-only demo mode from entry points, registries, logging, and startup scripts (Wave 1)
  - [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Delete wrapper services/routers that bridge to legacy modules; inline exception/retry utilities; neutralize research_engine providers (Wave 1)
  - [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Delete legacy scripts and model files; update services/database.py and test fixtures (Wave 1)
  - [x] 01-04-PLAN.md — Delete legacy service directories, API directories, and linkedin_image_generation.py (Wave 2)
  - [x] 01-05-PLAN.md — Verification: grep/ls checks, backend import smoke test, pytest run, produce VERIFICATION.md (Wave 3)

### Phase 2: CF Bindings Removal + Schema Migration
**Goal**: open-seo-main compiles and runs as a Node.js server with no Cloudflare runtime dependencies and a PostgreSQL-dialect Drizzle schema.
**Depends on**: Nothing (can run parallel with Phase 1)
**Requirements**: CF-01, CF-02, CF-03, CF-04, CF-05, CF-06, DB-01, DB-02, DB-03, DB-04, DB-05, DB-06, DB-07, DB-08, BUILD-01, BUILD-02, BUILD-03
**Working directory**: `open-seo-main/`
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `grep -r "cloudflare:workers" open-seo-main/src/` returns zero matches
  2. `pnpm run build` completes with no TypeScript or Rollup errors and produces `.output/server/index.mjs`
  3. `node .output/server/index.mjs` starts an HTTP server and all routes return correct responses
  4. `drizzle-kit migrate` applies all PG-dialect migrations to a fresh PostgreSQL instance without errors
**Plans**: TBD

---

### Phase 3: BullMQ + Redis KV Replacement
**Goal**: Site audit jobs run reliably via BullMQ on Redis; no Cloudflare runtime references remain in the audit path.
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: KV-01, KV-02, KV-03, BQ-01, BQ-02, BQ-03, BQ-04, BQ-05, BQ-06, BQ-07
**Working directory**: `open-seo-main/`
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Triggering a site audit enqueues a BullMQ job and the worker executes all steps to completion
  2. Audit crawl progress reads/writes via ioredis with correct TTL semantics (`audit-progress:` prefix, 30-min expiry)
  3. Failed jobs after max retries appear in `failed-audits` dead-letter queue
**Plans**: TBD

---

### Phase 4: Unified Docker Infrastructure
**Goal**: Both platforms run on a single VPS behind one nginx, sharing PostgreSQL and Redis, with a single `docker compose up` command.
**Depends on**: Phase 2, Phase 3 (open-seo Node.js stable), Phase 1 (AI-Writer cleaned)
**Requirements**: DOCKER-01, DOCKER-02, DOCKER-03, DOCKER-04, DOCKER-05, DOCKER-06, DOCKER-07
**Working directory**: `/` (TeveroSEO root — new unified docker-compose.vps.yml)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `docker compose -f docker-compose.vps.yml up -d` at TeveroSEO root brings all 7 services up healthy
  2. `curl https://app.openseo.so/healthz` returns `{ status: "ok" }`
  3. `curl https://<ai-writer-domain>/api/health` returns 200
  4. `docker compose -f docker-compose.vps.yml ps` shows all services as healthy
**Plans**: TBD

---

### Phase 5: CI/CD Pipeline
**Goal**: Both platforms auto-deploy to VPS on push to main with zero manual intervention; migrations run before new containers go live.
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: CI-01, CI-02, CI-03, CI-04, CI-05, CI-06
**Working directory**: TeveroSEO root (shared `.github/workflows/`)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Pushing to `main` triggers deploy workflow; VPS shows new container within 5 minutes
  2. GitHub Actions workflow completes green with migration step before container swap
  3. `KNOWN_HOSTS` used; no `StrictHostKeyChecking=no`
  4. AI-Writer auto-deploys via separate parallel workflow
**Plans**: TBD

---

### Phase 6: Clerk + Per-Client Workspace Integration
**Goal**: open-seo-main authenticates via Clerk and scopes all audit/keyword data by `client_id` from AI-Writer's client registry.
**Depends on**: Phase 4 (unified infra running)
**Requirements**: AUTH-01, AUTH-02, AUTH-03, AUTH-04
**Working directory**: `open-seo-main/`
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Unauthenticated requests to open-seo API return 401; authenticated requests with valid Clerk session succeed
  2. `GET /api/audits?client_id=X` returns only audits for client X
  3. Passing an invalid `client_id` returns 403
**Plans**: TBD

---

### Phase 7: AppShell SEO Integration
**Goal**: SEO audit and keyword tools appear as a nav section in the AI-Writer AppShell; active client context passes automatically to open-seo pages.
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Requirements**: SHELL-01, SHELL-02, SHELL-03, SHELL-04, SHELL-05
**Working directory**: `AI-Writer/`
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. "SEO Audit" nav item visible in AI-Writer sidebar; clicking it loads open-seo pages without a page reload
  2. Switching client in the switcher updates the `client_id` passed to open-seo pages
  3. open-seo pages use the same StatusChip, PageHeader, and CSS tokens as the rest of the shell
**Plans**: TBD
